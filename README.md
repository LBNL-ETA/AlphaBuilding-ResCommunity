# AlphaBuilding ResCommunity

This is the official repository of AlphaBuilding ResCommunity, a multi-agent OpenAI Gym Environment for Thermally Controlled Loads (TCLs) Coordination. An introduction to this environment can be found in the following paper:

# Overview
Wind and Solar combined accounts for 9% of total Unite States electricity generation in 2019, and is expected to make up of at least 40% of the generation mix by 2050. Higher renewable penetration requires more efficient demand side management to maintain real time balance of the grid. 

We developed AlphaBuilding ResCommunity, a multi-agent OpenAI Gym Environment that can be used to train TCLs Coordination algorithms to shift the load and provide grid services. In this repository: a. we develope and open source a realistic virtual environment using large scale connected smart thermostat data; b. We demonstrate how this environment could be used to develop, test and compare control algorithms for load coordination of residential buildings.

Compared with existing efforts, *AlphaBuilding ResCommunity* has the following two advantages:
- More realistic, because: a. the mdoel parameter values are inferred from a database recording the building operational data of more than 80,000 households in the Unite States; b. we consider occupancy schedule and other heat gains that have been ignored in existing studies.
- Simple software dependence and easy to use. *AlphaBuilding ResCommunity* is wrapped up using the standardize OpenAI Gym enivorenment, that is widely used in the Reinforcement Learning community.
